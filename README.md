## Round off all Object Dimensions in InDesign

Modified from Roundhouse, started by [Derrick](https://github.com/dvschultz/roundhouse) and improved by [Allen](https://github.com/tealtan/roundhouse/):
+ only rounds selected objects
+ skips over locked objects (you shouldn't be able to select locked objects anyway)
+ before rounding, it runs Fits Frame to Content on the selected object. so you can set the Cmd+Option+C shortcut to run this script instead.
